- *loginpage: Implementing api's to set up a login and signup page, with routing links and logout - done through Firebase

# *Please note:
Due to these projects not being deployed, React dependcies are prevelant and have not been solved. Some projects therefore do not have associated files to be able to completely run the code, screnshots however are inserted on these certain projects to view the end result.
